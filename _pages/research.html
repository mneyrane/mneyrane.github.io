<h1>Research</h1>
<hr>

<p>
My primary research interest is in the mathematics of machine learning.
The origins of this interest came about when I first heard the major milestone achieved by Google's DeepMind and their Go program "AlphaGo".
This was back in 2016, midway through undergrad and during a time where I have not yet heard the term "machine learning".
Since then, I have not ceased to be fascinated or curious about machine learning and understanding its mathematics.

<h2>MSc program</h2>

<h4>Overview</h4>

<p>
In a broad sense, my MSc research topic is on <em>deep learning for compressive imaging</em>.
The research focuses on constructing deep neural networks that are stable and efficient for image reconstruction on gradient-sparse images. This takes inspiration and builds on the work in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08286">this paper</a> authored by Antun, Colbrook and Hansen, some of whom are my supervisor's collaborators.
My research touches upon several areas of mathematics, including convex optimization, compressed sensing, machine learning and computability theory.

<h4>Contributed talks</h4>

<p>
I have presented different stages of my MSc research in contributed talks.
</p>

<p>
So far in 2021, I have presented at 
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Online International Conference on Computational Harmonic Analysis (ICCHA) <a href="https://www.univie.ac.at/projektservice-mathematik/e/index.php?event=ICCHA2021online">(link)</a></li>
  <li>CAIMS Annual Meeting <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/canadian-applied-industrial-math-society-annual-meeting-2021/">(link)</a></li>
  <li>Ottawa Mathematics Conference (OMC) <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ottawamath2019/home">(link)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
with the talks titled <em>"Provably Accurate, Stable and Efficient Deep Neural Networks for Compressive Imaging"</em> at ICCHA and a similar title for CAIMS and OMC.
