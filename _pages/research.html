<h1>Research</h1>
<hr>

<p>
My primary research interest is in the mathematics of machine learning.
The origins of this interest came about when I first heard the major milestone achieved by Google's DeepMind and their Go program "AlphaGo".
This was back in 2016, midway through undergrad and during a time where I have not yet heard the term "machine learning".
Since then, I have not ceased to be fascinated or curious about machine learning and understanding its mathematics.

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
In a broad sense, my MSc research topic is on <em>deep learning for compressive imaging</em>.
The research focuses on constructing deep neural networks that are accurate, stable, and efficient for image reconstruction on gradient-sparse images. This takes inspiration and builds on the work in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08286">this paper</a> authored by Antun, Colbrook and Hansen, some of whom are my supervisor's collaborators.
My research touches upon several areas of mathematics, including convex optimization, compressed sensing, machine learning and computability theory.
