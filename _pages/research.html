<h1>Research</h1>
<hr>

<p>
My primary research interest is in the mathematics of machine learning.
The origins of this interest came about when I first heard the major milestone achieved by Google's DeepMind and their Go program "AlphaGo".
This was back in 2016, midway through undergrad and during a time where I have not yet heard the term "machine learning".
Since then, I have not ceased to be fascinated or curious about machine learning and understanding its mathematics.

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
My MSc research topic is on <em>deep learning for compressive imaging</em>.
The research focuses on constructing deep neural networks that are accurate, stable, and efficient for image reconstruction on gradient-sparse images. This takes inspiration and builds on the work in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08286">this paper</a> authored by Antun, Colbrook and Hansen, some of whom collaborate with my supervisor.
My research touches upon several areas of mathematics, including convex optimization, compressed sensing, and deep learning.
