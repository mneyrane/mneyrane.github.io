<h3>Hearts AI</h3>
<p>
Here myself and Murphy Vu develop several AIs to play the Hearts card game. 
Hearts is a trick-taking card game played on a standard deck of 52 cards, with randomness and imperfect information.
Despite this, there are strategies to win more often than not. 
The purpose of this project is to learn about and implement various AI algorithms (reinforcement learning methods, Monte Carlo tree search, counterfactual regret minimization) and see how each fairs against one another, and against human players!

<p>
I worked as a data scientist for Statistics Canada for almost two years during my undergrad.
Over that time, I contributed to the development of the <a href="https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/lode">Linkable Open Data Environment (LODE)</a>, an open source project for data processing, distribution and visualization.
I wrote <code>opentabulate</code>, a Python package and a command line interface for tabulating data.
The main purpose of OpenTabulate is to programmatically convert regularly updated datasets (with a consistent schema) into CSV format with a user-defined schema.
OpenTabulate is used internally in my section to put together datasets, which are released <a href="https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/lode/databases">publicly</a> with an open data license.
