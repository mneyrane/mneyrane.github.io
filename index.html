<h1>About me</h1>
<hr>

<p>
Hello and welcome! I am Maksym (or Max).
I am currently a MSc student at Simon Fraser University in applied mathematics, progressing towards completing a master's thesis. 
My MSc program is supervised under professors Ben Adcock (supervisor) and Nilima Nigam (committee).
The thesis topic is in <em>deep learning for compressive imaging</em>, though I hold general interest in machine learning, mathematical analysis and various other topics in mathematics.
During my program this year, I was the recipient of the <a href="https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/pg-cs/cgsm-bescm_eng.asp">NSERC CGS-M</a> and <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/gradstudies/awards-funding/entrance-awards.html#bc-grad">BC Graduate scholarship</a>, valued at $17,500 and $15,000 (CAD), respectively.
