<h1>About me</h1>
<hr>

<p>
Hello and welcome! I am Maksym (or Max). 
This is my academic portfolio website, which also includes my extracurricular, work and school projects.

</p>
<p>
I am currently a MSc student at Simon Fraser University in applied mathematics, progressing towards completing a master's thesis. 
My MSc program is supervised under professors <a href="https://benadcock.org/">Ben Adcock</a> (supervisor) and <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/~nna29/NilimaNigam/Main.html">Nilima Nigam</a> (committee).
The thesis topic is in <em>deep learning for compressive imaging</em>, though I hold general interest in machine learning, mathematical analysis and various other topics in mathematics.
</p>
<p>
During my program this year, I was fortunate to be the recipient of the <a href="https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/pg-cs/cgsm-bescm_eng.asp">NSERC CGS-M</a> and <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/gradstudies/awards-funding/entrance-awards.html#bc-grad">BC Graduate scholarship</a>.
Each were valued at $17,500 and $15,000 (CAD), respectively.
