Hello, I am Maksym (Max), and welcome to my academic and industry portfolio website!
</p>

<p class="fw-bold">
I am currently a <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">PhD</abbr> student at Simon Fraser University in mathematics, with <a href="https://benadcock.org/">Ben Adcock</a> as my research supervisor.
My research topic, which is in development and subject to change, examines adaptive sampling applied to operator learning.
</p>

<p>
I have previously completed a <abbr title="Master of Science">MSc</abbr> in applied mathematics from Simon Fraser University, where I successfully defended my master's thesis on March 3, 2023.
Prior to that, I worked as a data scientist for Statistics Canada for about 1.5 years in conjunction with completing an undergraduate degree in mathematics.
