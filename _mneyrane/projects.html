Distinct from my academic work, here is a showcase of programming work and hobbyist projects that I'm proud to share.

Herein I independently explore and examine the <a href="https://datasf.org/opendata/">open data</a> of San Francisco's fire service calls, safety complaints and incidents.  

To conduct data exploration, I extract and clean the fire service data to then analyze it by collecting descriptive statistics and examining trends via inferential statistics.
This is done in Python using <code>pandas</code>, <code>geopandas</code>, <code>scipy.stats</code> and <code>seaborn</code>.
The potential impact of this analysis is to gain insight on fire department usage, effectiveness, and to inform emergency decision-making to increase public safety.

<h5 class="fw-bold">Strongly solving Quantik</h5>

<a href="https://en.gigamic.com/game/quantik">Quantik</a> is a two-player adversarial abstract strategy game by Nouri Khalifa, published by Gigamic.
The rules of the game are simple and reminiscent of Tic-tac-toe, but to contrast, Quantik has a larger state-space complexity and describing optimal play for either player is nontrivial.
</p>

<p>
I wrote a strong solver for Quantik in C. 
That is, assuming both players use minimax strategies, the solver determines which moves can force a win for the current player.
Combining a pruned minimax search, a tiny opening book compressed by board permutations, and CPU cache-friendly C code, the solver determines winning and losing moves in <i>under one second for any state</i>.

<p>
<span class="text-muted">(Jun 2018 - Aug 2020)</span>
When I worked as a data scientist at Statistics Canada, I coded and documented <code>opentabulate</code>, a Python command-line tool to tabulate data together under a common schema.
The key motivation for <code>opentabulate</code> is to support the <i>Linkable Open Data Environment</i> <a href="https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/lode">(LODE)</a>, a data portal that builds and distributes public Canadian infrastructure datasets under an open data license.
Most of the data originates from municipal, provincial and federal authorities in Canada, but vary in format and schema by jurisdiction.
My division <a href="https://github.com/CSBP-CPSE/LODE-ECDO">uses</a> <code>opentabulate</code> to automate the extraction, cleaning and merging of such data.
