I worked as a data scientist for Statistics Canada for almost two years during my undergrad.
Over that time, I contributed to the development of the <a href="https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/lode">Linkable Open Data Environment (LODE)</a>, an open source project for data processing, distribution and visualization.
I wrote <code>opentabulate</code>, a Python package and a command line interface for tabulating data.
The main purpose of OpenTabulate is to programmatically convert regularly updated datasets (with a consistent schema) into CSV format with a user-defined schema.
OpenTabulate is used internally in my section to put together datasets, which are released <a href="https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/lode/databases">publicly</a> with an open data license.
